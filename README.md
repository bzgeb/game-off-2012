## The Game

Rhythm Rails is a rhythm racing game.  
Made for the Github Game-Off 2012 in the month of November.

# How To Play
Tap to the beat to _push_ your racer forward. Stay in _sync_ to reach top speed. Jump to reach different _branches_ and grab powerups. Grab powerups to decrease your time. Race to finish in the shortest time.

Playable at bzgeb.github.com/game-off-2012
